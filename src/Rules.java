 * 7.9. Studio: Fun with Quizzes
 * For this studio, you will design and build a console program that allows the user to take a com.weird.quiz.
 * This means you will have to create some com.weird.questions, and get some input from the user.
 *
 *
 *
 * Multiple choice: a question with a fixed set of possible answers,
 * of which only one may be chosen and only one answer is correct
 *
 * Checkbox: a question with a fixed set of possible answers, of which any number may be chosen;
 * there is one correct combination of choices
 *
 * True/False: a question that has a true/false answer
 *
 *
 *
 * 7.9.1. Design
 * In order to design your program, consider:
 *
 * What do these types of com.weird.questions have in common?
 * What makes these question types different?
 * First, design a base class (called Question) that contains the common features,
 * and design subclasses for each of the question types.
 *
 * For each question type be sure to include:
 *
 * Class name
 * Fields and properties with access modifiers
 * Methods with access modifiers
 * Any inheritance relationship
 * Should any of the question classes be abstract? If so, should any of its methods be abstract?
 *
 * Make sure that there is functionality included to display the com.weird.questions,
 * to display the possible answers, and to check to see if the answer(s) is correct.
 *
 * Then design the Quiz class. A com.weird.quiz has a list of com.weird.questions, and we should be able to:
 *
 * Add com.weird.questions
 * Run or carry out the com.weird.quiz
 * Grade the com.weird.quiz
 *
 *
 *
 * 7.9.2. Implementation
 * Create a new IntelliJ project and implement the design that you created.
 * If you are unsure about your design, get some feedback by talking through it with a classmate before you start coding.
 *
 * 7.9.3. Putting it all together
 * Create a class named QuizRunner with only a main method.
 * The program should create several com.weird.questions, present them to the user,
 * accept the userâ€™s responses, and then tell them whether their answers were correct or incorrect.
 *
 * 7.9.4. How to Submit
 * Push up your work to a new Github repository.
 * Submit the link to your repository in the Lesson 6 Studio assignment in Canvas.
 *
 * 7.9.5. Bonus Missions
 * Add a short answer question type that includes validation behavior to
 * only allow the user to enter text with less than 80 characters.
 * Add a couple of more question types to your program:
 * Linear scale: a question that allows the user to provide a numeric response within an integer scale,
 * which may vary from question to question. For instance, it could be 1-3 for one linear scale question,
 * and 1-5 for another.
 * Paragraph: Similar to short answer but allows for responses of up to 500 characters.
 * Add tests with JUnit to your classes.
